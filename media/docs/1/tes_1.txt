Dear Colleagues,
State universities and community college retirees and employees face increasing threats to
their pension and health benefits. The State of Illinois continues to face a structural deficit
problem. The qovemor's recent push to sell the lottery system for an estimated $10 billion is
clear evidence of the problem. Rumors suggest that SURS will see yet a third year of
underfunding.
SUAA took action several years ago to address challenges to the current system of funding
your pensions commonly referred to as defined benefits plans. After several years of
preparation SUAA created SUAACTION, a political involvement committee to become
politically active. In the past it was possible to successfully advocate legislatively through
lobbying. This is no longer the case since politics in Illinois has become a pay to play game.
To address these challenges to both active and retired SURS members, SUAA in 2005
established SUAACTION. SUAACTION will serve as the political advocacy ann of SUAA.
Through SUAACTION, SUM will maintain a permanent political presence in Springfield in
addition to lobbying in the traditional manner. If successful our move will send a clear signal
to those wanting to continue to underfund your retirement system and reduce or eliminate
hard earned benefits.

SUAACTION will focus its activities in four major areas: (1) securing full funding for SURS
in accordance with the 1995 pension law and oppose all efforts to further erode our pension
benefits; (2) promoting the highest ethical and professional standards in the management of
SURS assets; (3) preserving the health benefits we now enjoy; (4) expanding efforts to
eliminate Social Security penalties, the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and
Government Pension Offset (GPO).
The SUAACTION political advocacy program wilt be expensive, and dues cannot be used
for political purposes since SUAA is a non-profit, bi-partisan organization. SUAACTION has
recommended that its activities be financed by voluntary contributions. Will you 'Volunteer?
If SUAACTIQN is to be successful, it needs your support. If you have not yet contributed to
SUAACTION, please do so now by using the form below. If you have already made a
contribution, we thank you for your support. Additional contributions are always welcome

Thank you in advance for helping us move forward.
